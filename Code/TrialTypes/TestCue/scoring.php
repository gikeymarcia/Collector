	// This is because in Login.php, the program will actually load each of
	// these scoring files, in order to find the columns (keys) needed in the
	// output file of this experiment.
	// So, first check for $findingKeys, and if that evaluates to true, return
	// an array of the columns needed to properly record all the data for this
	// trial.
	// This must be done, even if there are no new columns being added.

	// To make sure that everything is recorded, just throw all of POST into
	// $data, which will eventually be recorded into the output file.
	// To create new columns, simply assign the new data you want to record
	// to a new key in $data.
	// For example,    $data[ 'New Column' ] = "Hello";    would make a new
	// column titled "New Column" in the output, and every row for this trial
	// type would have the value "Hello".
    $data = $_POST;
	
	
	// Below here, you can do whatever custom scoring you want.
