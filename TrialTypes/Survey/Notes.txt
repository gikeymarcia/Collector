Survey

The Cue for this trial should be a filename
of a file located in Common/Surveys/

All Surveys are stored in Experiments/_Common/Surveys
For formatting of surveys, look at the sample surveys. DEMOGRAPHICS and DIAGNOSTICS are found in the Sample Surveys.

FIRST - go to your STIMULI FILE and then add a new row. For example, if you'd like to add demographics and diagnostics do it like this

     Cue            Answer      Shuffle 1 
2  demographics.csv  off           off

SECOND - go to your PROCEDURE FILE and it should look like this
   Item	  TrialType  Timing    Post 1 Trial
2   2       Survey     user        user

THIRD - That's it!
____________________________________________


Each survey file is like another stimuli file.
Inside, there should be the following columns:

Question
    Text to be displayed for this question
Question Name
    The column this question's data will be stored under
Type
    The format of the question. These formats can be found
    inside this trial type's folder, in the Type/ subfolder
    You can find more details about each type by looking at
    their specific file.
Answers
    For survey types with limited answers, such as likert 
    or dropdown responses, the options are defined in this
    column. Ranges can be defined, with "|" as the separator
    and "::" as the connector, so something like "1::4|10"
    will create the answers (1, 2, 3, 4, 10). You can also 
    use non-numeric answers, such as "Not at all | Slightly,
    Greatly | Completely".
Values (Optional)
    These can be used with scoring column to determine the
    numeric value of each of the answers. For example, you
    could set the Answers to "Not at all, Slightly, Greatly,
    Completely", and code these as "0, 1, 2, 3", so that
    scores can be calculated by summing/averaging these
    responses. You can re-use values, but there must be an
    equal number of values and answers (so, "0, 0, 1, 1" is
    fine, but "0, 1" with 4 answers would not work). If there
    aren't the same number of values and answers, an error
    message will be displayed.
    If you don't create this column, or you leave a row
    blank under this column, the actual answer will be used
    directly, assuming it is numeric.
    The actual answer will still be recorded as raw data.
Required (Optional)
    Questions can be marked as required or not, and
    participants will not be able to submit the page without
    first answering this question. By default, questions are
    required, but if you put "No" in this column, then this
    question can be left blank.
Shuffle (Optional)
    Shuffling survey files works the same as any other
    Collector spreadsheet, and you can test out your shuffles
    using the Collector Tool "ShuffleTester".
Score [type]: X
    Any column starting with "Score" will be treated as
    instructions for scoring the data. Before the colon,
    you can also add the keyword "Average", to have the sum
    converted into an average (by default, the sum will be
    recorded in the data). For example,
    "Score Average: Depression" will create a column in the
    output called "Score_Depression" with the average value
    of the responses for this scale. In this column, a blank
    cell means that the current question should not be 
    considered for this score, so you can set up multiple 
    sub-scales to be calculated for the same survey.

Certain types will use additional columns, most commonly a
"Settings" column. Look at the files for that type in the
Type/ subfolder of the survey trial type for more information.
