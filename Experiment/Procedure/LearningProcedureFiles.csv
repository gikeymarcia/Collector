0,Instruct,User,<h2>Welcome to the Collector tutorial!</h2><p>This condition is designed to help familiarize you with the three primary files that you will be modifying when creating your experiments.</p>,# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"The three primary files are: Conditions.txt, a procedure file, and a stimuli file.<br/><br/>Each of the above files are comma-separated value (CSV) files.  Basically, they are excel spreadsheets saved as CSVs.",# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"The first file I want you to open is Conditions.csv.  This file is located in 'Experiment' folder and should be opened in Excel.  Once you have opened the file click ""Done"" below.",# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"<p>Now that the file is opened you should take note of the first row of cells (Number/Stimuli/Procedure/Condition Description/Condition Notes)</p><p>These cells are the headers that tell you what information goes into each column.  Each row below the headers is a different condition in the experiment.  This instructional condition is condition number 1. <p/>Find the row that corresponds to condition 1 and the click ""Done"" below.",# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"For each condition in an experiment we must give:<ol><li>the 'Number' which tells us the order conditions will be cycled through</li><li>the 'Stimuli' tells the program which set of stimuli will be displayed</li><li>the 'Procedure' tells the program which file will determine the presentation order for a given condition</li><li>the 'Condition Description' and 'Condition Notes' are for you to leave either a more detailed description of what a conditon is (e.g., """"blocked practice of male faces"""")  or to leave whatever notes about your conditions that you think will be useful during data analysis.</li></ol><br /><br/> Each of the above pieces of information about a given condition will be recorded with every line of data collected for that particular experiment.",# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"Look at the row for condition 'Number' 1 and open up the correct 'Stimuli' file.  Remember to open the file using Excel or some other spreadsheet program.  Click ""Done"" when you've opened up the file<p>Hint: a string of text followed by '/' denotes a folder (e.g., 'image/dog.jpg' points to a file 'dog.jpg' inside of the folder 'image').</p>",# new fix
0,Instruct,User,"You should have opened the file 'LearningStimFiles.csv'.  If you did not then look over the conditions.txt file until you understand why 'LearningStimFiles.csv' corresponds to condition 1.<p>Take note of the first row of cells (Cue/Target/Answer/Shuffle/Stimuli Notes).  Just as with conditons.csv, these cells are the headers which tell you what information goes into each column.  Each row below the headers is a piece of stimuli.</p>",# new fix
